<h1>The Best Movies According to Valerie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>Wolf go brrr.</p>

<h3>Soul</h3>
<p>Nice message and strangely adult-focused for a Pixar Movie.</p>

<h3>Anthropoid</h3>
<p>
There is no good reason for me to like this.<br />
I just like that it has both Cillian Murphy and Harry Lloyd.
